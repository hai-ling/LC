# neetcode general study

## General practices:
- Understand why the problem solution is its designation (greedy, dp, etc)
- Understand brute force sol'n and time/space comp
- Try to find optimal solution
- Consider time/space comp optimizations
- After solving solution, view video for alternative solutions

#### Notes
    --> For arrays, don't forget to consider iterating backwards

### Arrays and Hashing
- dict.get(key, default value) is useful when key may not exist yet
### Greedy

### Heap
- Heap is a binary tree, where root is always smaller than its child.
    - given root k, the child is always 2k+[1 or 2]
- Python uses heapq and its functions
